# Vanilla Versus Rework

Thanks to SirPlease and the many people who have worked on the [Competitive Rework](https://github.com/SirPlease/L4D2-Competitive-Rework), which I've used as the foundation for this project.
Special thanks to Derpduck for helping with plugins, and anyone who has helped testing this project out.
Credits to Orin for the reserve ammo plugin.

This is not meant to be installed as a standalone config, and you must have the [Competitive Rework](https://github.com/SirPlease/L4D2-Competitive-Rework) in order for this to work.


View the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/MrFailzz/FailzzMod/wiki) to see a list of all changes done. Still a work in progress.
